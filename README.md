# QXDM-Logs-Search
Air Interface Logs Analysis

This Python script is created to help tester learn and analyze Air Interface messages

The script is written based on a sample QXDM text log provided.

The script look for all the lines with date and extract the messages with regex for user

Though script will do the job for all messages but text which may not be useful for testers, not suggested for search

However, testers can learn or get info for more than 300 messages which are displayed for users to choose from

Info specific to QXDM is not shown in this repository

Here is how it would look for a message which appeared only once in the log

The script gives the luxury to users to go all occurance of the same messages one by one by just entring the numeric value of the occurance
